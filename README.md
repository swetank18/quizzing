## Development Notes

I originally tried uploading my local repository directly to GitHub, but encountered issues with the remote repository setup. Due to this, I uploaded the core project files manually to ensure the code is available and organized for easy cloning and use.

## File Overview

- `index.html` — Main structure and markup
- `styles.css` — Custom styling and animations
- `script.js` — Quiz logic, timer, scoring, and storage
